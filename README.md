# Association-Rules
This project applies Association Rule Learning to retail2.csv, a market basket dataset. It identifies frequent itemsets and generates rules by computing support, confidence, and liftâ€”using base R and loops only, without external libraries like arules.

#a. Use Groceries. Calculate intersting rules with support= 0.01 and confidence= 0.5 
#Identify three rules with the highest confidence and three rules with highest lift. 

if(!require("arules"))install.packages("arules")

#library(arulesViz)
library(RColorBrewer)


data("Groceries") #import data
summary(Groceries) #summary of the data set
#inspect(Groceries) #show all transactions
inspect(head(Groceries, 6)) #show first 6 transactions
arules::itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, topN = 20, 
                          col = brewer.pal(8, 'Pastel2'),
                          main = 'Relative Item Frequency Plot',
                          type = "relative",
                          ylab = "Item Frequency (Relative)")

? apriori #we use apriori to generate association rules 
grocery_rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.5))
grgg<-as(grocery_rules, "data.frame") #we make the rules into a dataframe
summary(grocery_rules) #summary of the association rules
inspect(grocery_rules[1:10]) #first 10 identified interesting rules
top.lift <- sort(grocery_rules, decreasing = TRUE, na.last = NA, by = "lift") #sort by lift
inspect(head(top.lift, 10))

#honey and whole mlik have a lift of 2.87.Positive causation, its probably Whole milk, when Honig have been purchased
#honey and whole milk, have a confidence of 73%. Meaning that Whole Milk is purchased when honey is purchased
#honey and whole mlik support: is minor than 1% so is not a common rule
