# Association-Rules
This project applies Association Rule Learning to retail2.csv, a market basket dataset. It identifies frequent itemsets and generates rules by computing support, confidence, and liftâ€”using base R and loops only, without external libraries like arules.

#a. Use Groceries. Calculate intersting rules with support= 0.01 and confidence= 0.5 
#Identify three rules with the highest confidence and three rules with highest lift.

#honey and whole mlik have a lift of 2.87.Positive causation, its probably Whole milk, when Honig have been purchased
#honey and whole milk, have a confidence of 73%. Meaning that Whole Milk is purchased when honey is purchased

#race=white and native country US: lif of 1.02 It indicates this two things are independent.
